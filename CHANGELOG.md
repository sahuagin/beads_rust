## v0.2.10 -- 2026-05-14 (Release)

This version supersedes `v0.2.9` by fixing the remaining Windows release-build
portability issue in the doctor subsystem and tightening installer integrity
failure handling.

### Release Fixes

- Kept the `mimalloc` Windows exclusion from `v0.2.9`, which removed the
  MinGW `libmimalloc-sys` C build failure.
- Gated POSIX-only doctor permission checks behind Unix `cfg`s and added
  conservative non-Unix handling for repair backups, chmod-style operations,
  symlink creation, and undo artifact permissions so the Windows release target
  compiles again.
- Re-cut the release after `v0.2.9` had already been published to crates.io,
  because crates.io package versions are immutable and the Windows doctor
  portability fix changes the release source.
- Installer checksum mismatches now fail closed instead of falling back to a
  source build after artifact verification fails; the regression test now uses
  a local file URL so release-preparation runs do not block on network fallback
  behavior.
- Package-manager manifest templates now track the DSR-published
  `br-<version>-<platform>` archive names and current `v0.2.10` checksums, so
  future manifest automation does not keep looking for stale `br-v...` assets.
- The installer and release workflow now keep the tag name (`vX.Y.Z`) separate
  from package asset names (`br-X.Y.Z-...`), preventing future binary installs
  and manifest updates from disagreeing about release artifact URLs.

### Validation

- `v0.2.10` validation includes the dependency-update checks from `v0.2.8`, the
  allocator fix from `v0.2.9`, and a focused
  `cargo check --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --release` pass covering the
  Windows doctor portability fix.
- Post-release fresh-eyes validation also checked the Homebrew/Scoop/AUR
  manifest templates against the published DSR assets.
- Follow-up validation traced the same asset naming rule through `install.sh`,
  `br upgrade`, and the release workflow fragment harness.

## v0.2.9 -- 2026-05-14 (Crates.io, superseded)

This version superseded `v0.2.8` by removing the dependency-level Windows
allocator failure after the dependency refresh, but was itself superseded by
`v0.2.10` for a separate doctor portability fix.

### Release Fixes

- Kept `mimalloc` enabled for Linux and macOS builds, but removed it from
  Windows builds so the MinGW release target no longer fails inside
  `libmimalloc-sys`' bundled C build.
- Re-cut the release after `v0.2.8` had already been published to crates.io,
  because crates.io package versions are immutable and the Windows build fix
  changes the release source.

### Validation

- `v0.2.9` validation includes the same dependency-update checks as `v0.2.8`,
  plus a Windows release-build retry proving the MinGW allocator failure was
  replaced by a separate doctor portability issue.

## v0.2.8 -- 2026-05-14 (Crates.io, superseded)

This version refreshes the dependency stack, including the local `/dp` FastMCP and frankensqlite libraries now published on crates.io, and tightens storage reliability around the updated SQLite engine.

### Dependency Updates

- Updated the fsqlite stack used by storage and sync paths to the latest published local versions: `fsqlite*` `0.1.3` and `fsqlite-vfs` `0.1.4`.
- Confirmed the direct dependency set is otherwise current with `cargo outdated --root-deps-only`.
- Updated `fastmcp-rust` and its FastMCP crate family to `0.3.1`.

### Reliability

- Kept explicit `--lock-timeout` reads on the conservative storage-open path, so users asking for lock-aware behavior do not accidentally route through the read-only fast-open bypass.
- Reduced noisy expected fsqlite diagnostics during transient WAL tail-read fallback while preserving warnings for unexpected blocked-cache failures.
- Tightened concurrency and doctor chokepoint tests around the updated storage behavior.

### Validation

- Passed `cargo check --all-targets --all-features`.
- Passed `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`.
- Passed `cargo fmt --check` and `git diff --check`.
- Passed `cargo test --all-features --no-fail-fast`, including doctests.
- Passed `cargo publish --dry-run --locked --allow-dirty` for `beads_rust v0.2.8`.

## [v0.1.33](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/releases/tag/v0.1.33) -- 2026-03-23 (Release)

This release supersedes the partial `v0.1.32` fallback build by fixing release automation so `dsr` can produce installer-compatible assets deterministically.

### Release and CI

- **Rust cache pinning** was updated across all GitHub workflows to the current signed `Swatinem/rust-cache` v2.9.1 commit after the prior pinned SHA stopped resolving and broke fallback builds.
- **Release builds now fail closed on missing artifacts**: Linux ARM64 and Windows AMD64 are treated as required release outputs instead of being silently omitted from a published release.
- **Cross-platform fallback coverage improved** by moving Linux ARM64 and Windows AMD64 fallback builds onto Linux-based cross-compilation paths, reducing dependence on specialized remote runners for those targets.

### Testing

- **Single-issue graph rendering** now preserves DFS subtree order in plain output so dependents render contiguously instead of visually nesting under later siblings.
- **List output regression coverage** now reflects the actual plain-output behavior for unknown custom statuses, keeping release validation aligned with user-visible CLI output.

## [v0.1.32](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/releases/tag/v0.1.32) -- 2026-03-23 (Release)

This release extends cross-project routing coverage, hardens storage for frankensqlite compatibility, and tightens the release pipeline around version and installer correctness.

### Cross-Project Routing

- **Route-aware dependency operations** now auto-flush correctly and enforce cross-project guards when adding or removing dependencies ([`4682499`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/4682499)).
- **Graph, delete, audit log, and lint** now respect external workspace routing instead of assuming the main project database only ([`5a983bc`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/5a983bc), [`d63f56c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/d63f56c), [`4f232bb`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/4f232bb), [`d231bce`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/d231bce), [`d4df28f`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/d4df28f)).
- **Auto-import propagation** now reaches all routing callsites, fixing path normalization and reducing stale cross-workspace reads ([`506b6cf`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/506b6cf), [`911b793`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/911b793)).

### Storage and Config Hardening

- **Prefix normalization** is now integrated through config, storage, and ID handling so runtime issue prefix mismatches resolve consistently ([`bdc0243`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/bdc0243), [`0575380`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/0575380)).
- **Normalized prefixes** now drop trailing separator characters before ID generation, preventing malformed runtime prefixes from producing awkward double-separator IDs.
- **Frankensqlite compatibility** improved again: batched `DELETE` and other remaining batched `IN`-clause operations were replaced with row-by-row queries to avoid engine-specific breakage ([`ba71494`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/ba71494), [`b9a0f25`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/b9a0f25), [`45b2a4e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/45b2a4e)).
- **Tombstone state handling** now keeps `closed_at` separate from `deleted_at`, records delete metadata when creating or importing tombstoned issues, and clears delete fields when an issue leaves tombstone state.
- **Doctor** now gives better guidance around root `.gitignore` conflicts and partial-index repair behavior ([`44d47e6`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/44d47e6), [`e6ef576`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/e6ef576)).
- **Agents command** handling is more robust for marker-block parsing, project-scoped search, and JSON output on mutating operations ([`1cf1aa9`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/1cf1aa9)).

### Release and CI

- **Release verification** now asserts that the built binary version exactly matches the release tag, closing a class of silent mis-versioning failures ([`3315bf5`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/3315bf5), [`b2a9ef5`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/b2a9ef5)).
- Packaging metadata and cache pinning were refreshed for release automation, and the Intel macOS build moved to the correct runner label ([`e137852`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/e137852), [`9f9f183`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/9f9f183)).

### Testing

- Added fresh regression coverage around blocked-cache close behavior, fresh-db behavior, custom status snapshots, lint routing, and the CI fixes required to keep those suites green ([`9869aca`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/9869aca), [`86f9c98`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/86f9c98), [`b657c0e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/b657c0e), [`a1e893e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/a1e893e), [`4cec0bb`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/4cec0bb), [`fe2ae0a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/fe2ae0a)).

## [v0.1.31](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/releases/tag/v0.1.31) -- 2026-03-21 (Release)

Focused hardening for concurrent agent workflows, plus a release-process cleanup pass.

### Storage and Reliability

- **Atomic config writes** using PID-scoped temp files to prevent partial-write corruption ([`e3a00e3`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/e3a00e3)).
- **Graceful missing-dependency fallback** in storage and graph code paths -- dangling dep references no longer crash ([`617572f`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/617572f), [`a1b63dd`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/a1b63dd)).
- **Blocked-cache hardening**: single-row inserts, deferred invalidation, INSERT OR REPLACE semantics, graceful read fallbacks ([`ad27f47`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/ad27f47), [`acedf9d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/acedf9d), [`f687166`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/f687166)).
- **Lazy config loading** and reduced sync lock contention, with checkpoint-on-close opt-out ([`a690d58`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/a690d58)).
- **Ready-query/storage fast path**: column-projected ready queries, compare-and-set claims, and JSONL size witnesses improve concurrency correctness and reduce unnecessary work ([`9550859`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/9550859)).
- Switch test storage from `:memory:` to temp files for better parity with production ([`5e8f91c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/5e8f91c)).

### Sync and Concurrency

- **Best-effort JSONL witness refresh**: opportunistic startup witness backfills no longer fail freshness probes when the JSONL file races away mid-refresh.
- **Auto-import SyncConflict downgraded to warning** for concurrent multi-agent writes ([`4bc6681`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/4bc6681)).
- Centralized ID resolution into `resolve_issue_id(s)` helpers across all commands ([`94c9138`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/94c9138)).
- Redundant index removal, simplified event inserts, added dependency thread index ([`311225e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/311225e)).

### Diagnostics

- **Doctor** now warns when root `.gitignore` hides `.beads/.gitignore` ([`5f1da48`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/5f1da48)).
- LazyLock regex in agents command, defer-first blocked-cache invalidation ([`87e0fe6`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/87e0fe6)).

### Testing

- Concurrent close/update/reopen blocked-cache integrity stress test ([`30d95b4`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/30d95b4)).
- Replace `DirGuard` with explicit db path overrides and extract JSON array test helper ([`95deac1`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/95deac1)).

### Documentation

- Rebuilt `CHANGELOG.md` from git history with live commit links ([`53fef3a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/53fef3a)).

### CI

- Renamed release body file to `RELEASE_NOTES.md` ([`9689bd2`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/9689bd2)).

### Documentation

- Implement community PRs #73, #163, #166: body alias confirmed, RUST_LOG=error docs, broken link fixed ([`144070e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/144070e)).

### CI

- Clone asupersync in all workflows (path dependency of fsqlite-core) ([`ce2ebe4`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/ce2ebe4)).

---

## [v0.1.27](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/releases/tag/v0.1.27) -- 2026-03-12 (Release)

Major architecture release: cross-project routing, TOON output everywhere, quiet mode, workspace failure resilience, and database snapshot infrastructure.

### Cross-Project Routing

- **Issue routing** with batched dispatch -- commands can now operate on issues in other workspaces via redirect configuration ([`be49fef`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/be49fef), [`9b43240`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/9b43240)).
- Routing extended to all mutation commands ([`9b43240`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/9b43240)).

### TOON Output Format

- TOON (Token-Optimized Object Notation) output support added to audit, lint, version, count, epic, stale, history, orphans, and query commands ([`9565af0`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/9565af0), [`6a1618c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/6a1618c)).
- Complete quiet mode support across all commands ([`9b43240`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/9b43240)).

### Database Resilience

- **Database family snapshot infrastructure** with sidecar quarantine and JSONL safety model ([`e430d4c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/e430d4c)).
- **Automatic database recovery** during issue mutation commands ([`21a1031`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/21a1031)).
- `probe_issue_mutation_write_path()` diagnostic helper distinguishes corruption from application errors ([`ca701a7`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/ca701a7)).
- Generalized JSONL recovery across all mutation commands with expanded doctor diagnostics ([`1e163ed`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/1e163ed)).
- Deferred blocked-cache refresh with stale-marker protocol ([`674b9bd`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/674b9bd)).

### Storage Engine

- **Incremental blocked-cache updates** with bulk cycle-check adjacency loading ([`d3d3e64`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/d3d3e64)).
- Blocked cache rewritten as atomic DELETE+INSERT with ForeignKeyGuard RAII ([`0a9609e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/0a9609e)).
- `mutate()` rewritten to delegate to `with_write_transaction` ([`0320d07`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/0320d07)).
- Consolidated `resolve_issue_id`, hardened ID parsing, fixed blocked cache and transaction API ([`9c02816`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/9c02816)).
- Multi-issue update validation, FK handling refactor, improved test isolation ([`a63769f`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/a63769f)).

### Sync

- Deterministic export ordering, streaming git log, simplified import FK handling ([`6e7ea09`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/6e7ea09)).
- Cycle detection switched to lazy per-node BFS, fixed duplicate event recording ([`f2e20d4`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/f2e20d4)).
- Symlink/gitdir invariant bypass prevented via early canonicalization ([`3a878c2`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/3a878c2)).
- Dirty-issue marking optimized with INSERT OR REPLACE, intra-JSONL collision detection fixed ([`ebf0783`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/ebf0783)).

### Import

## [v0.1.0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/releases/tag/v0.1.0) -- 2026-01-18 (Release, Draft)

Initial public release. A Rust port of [Steve Yegge's beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads), frozen at the "classic" SQLite + JSONL architecture.

### Core Feature Set

- **Full CLI** with all classic beads commands: init, create, list, show, update, close, reopen, delete, dep, blocked, ready, search, stale, count, stats, sync, doctor, q (quick capture).
- **SQLite + JSONL hybrid storage**: SQLite for fast local queries, JSONL for git-friendly collaboration.
- **Non-invasive design**: never executes git commands, never touches files outside `.beads/`, never auto-commits.
- **Agent-first**: every command supports `--json` for AI coding agent integration.
- **Dependency tracking** with cycle detection, blocked/ready issue management, and dependency trees.
- **Label system** with add/remove/list/list-all operations.
- **Comments** with add/list operations.
- **Config system** with layered precedence: CLI flags > env vars > project config > user config > defaults.

### Architecture (Built During Pre-v0.1.0 Development)
